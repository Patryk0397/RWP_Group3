206CDE Real World Project 


Games comparison website :

Must do:
Website that compares prices for games online (G2A or AMAzon)
Profile system that would store preferences and machine learning that would generate recommendations
The profile system would also store search history so the person can go back to the games they've previously browsed.
Price alerts 	

Nice to have:
Include the api for the websites so that we do one click buy
Include Youtube API so that we see trailers of the games
Include the Game website API for the reviews as well
Twitter for hashtags including the game title.
